The Fernsehturm is a television tower in the city centre. Close to Alexanderplatz and part of the World Federation of Great Towers, the tower was constructed between 1965 and 1969 by the former German Democratic Republic administration who intended it as a symbol of Berlin, which it remains today, as it is easily visible throughout the central and some suburban districts of Berlin. With its height of 368 meters, it is the tallest structure in Germany.
